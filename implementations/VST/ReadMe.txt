TTBlue VST Examples
Reflective C++ API for realtime processing
_________________________________________________________________


First: The VST SDK
Needs to be located at the same as this ReadMe file and be called vstsdk-2.4.


Second: Does it Work?
It has been tested and works in Live 7.0.7 on the Mac.


Third: What about VST3?
There aren’t many VST3 hosts.  
Also, at the time the example was created, it used the VST 3.0.0 SDK, which basically didn’t work.  
At the time of this writing, there is a bug in Steinberg’s site, so you can’t download the VST3 SDK either.
